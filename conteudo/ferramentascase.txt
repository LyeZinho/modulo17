Case tools are computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools. They are designed to aid in the development, maintenance and reengineering of software systems. CASE tools can be used for a variety of tasks such as requirements gathering, reverse engineering, design and modeling, code generation and testing. 


There are different groups of CASE tools: 
1) Requirements management tools help to gather, track and manage software requirements. 
2) Reverse engineering tools assist in the understanding of existing software systems. 
3) Design and modeling tools help in the creation of new software designs. 
4) Testing tools help verify the correctness of software systems.  

The main advantages of using CASE tools are: 
1) They help to automate the software development process. 
2) They improve the quality of software systems. 
3) They help to reduce the cost of developing software systems.
